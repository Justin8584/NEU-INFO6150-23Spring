                        The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. 
                        It is characterized by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. 
                        It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. 
                        It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.
                        
                        The breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. 
                        He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. 
                        The breed was recognized by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world. (Cited from Wikipedia/Golden Retriever)

                        The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. 
                        The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. 
                        Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. 
                        The beagle is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems. 
                        
                        The modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.
                        
                        Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings and more recently in film, television, and comic books. (Cited from Wikipedia/Beagles)

                        Husky is a general term for a dog used in the polar regions, primarily and specifically for work as sled dogs. 
                        It refers to a traditional northern type, notable for its cold-weather tolerance and overall hardiness.
                        Modern racing huskies that maintain arctic breed traits (also known as Alaskan huskies) represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs.
                        
                        Huskies have continued to be used in sled-dog racing, as well as expedition and trek style tour businesses, and as a means of essential transportation in rural communities.
                        Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs. (Cited from Wikipedia/Husky)
